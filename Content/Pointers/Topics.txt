1. Introduction to Pointers
   -> Definition and basic concept
   -> Syntax of pointer declaration (int* ptr;)
   -> NULL pointers

2. Pointer Operations
   -> Address-of operator (&)
   -> Dereference operator (*)
   -> Pointer assignment

3. Pointer and Variables
   -> Pointer to int, float, char
   -> Size of pointer

4. Pointer and Arrays
   -> Array name as a pointer
   -> Pointer arithmetic (ptr++, ptr+2)
   -> Accessing array elements using pointers

5. Pointer and Functions
   -> Call by value vs Call by reference
   -> Passing pointers to functions
   -> Returning pointers from functions

6. Pointer to Pointer (Double Pointer)
   -> Concept and syntax (int** p;)
   -> Use cases

7. Pointer and Strings
   -> Character pointers (char*)
   -> String manipulation using pointers

8. Dynamic Memory Allocation
   -> new and delete operators
   -> malloc(), calloc(), free() (C-style)
   -> Dangling pointers, memory leaks

9. Pointers to Structures
   -> Accessing structure members using pointers (->)

10. Function Pointers
   -> Declaring and using function pointers
   -> Callback mechanism

11. Const Pointers vs Pointer to Const
   -> const int* ptr vs int* const ptr

12. Void Pointers (void*)
   -> General-purpose pointers
   -> Limitations and typecasting

13. Smart Pointers (C++11 and above)
   -> unique_ptr
   -> shared_ptr
   -> weak_ptr
